# Prevail (WIP)
A clean, modern, Emulation Station theme for Batocera-ES with amazing animation

# TODO

In order of goals:
  - Color schemes other than red, but still based on CGA color palette
  - Menu options need to be added
  - Basic, detailed, and box views

Need help testing on different resolutions and hardware configurations to optimize.
